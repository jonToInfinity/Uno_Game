# Uno_Game in Python

This is a simple text-based implementation of the popular card game Uno in Python. While it's a basic version, it demonstrates the core game mechanics and rules. You can expand upon this code to create a more comprehensive Uno game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `uno_game.py` script to start the game.
2. The game starts with 4 players by default, but you can change the `num_players` variable to adjust the number of players.
3. Players are represented as "Player 1," "Player 2," and so on.
4. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a shuffled Uno deck.
5. The top card of the discard pile is displayed at the beginning.
6. Players take turns following these rules:
   - You can play a card if it matches the color or value of the top card on the discard pile, or if it's a Wild card.
   - If you can't play a valid card, you must draw one from the deck.
7. If you play a "Reverse" card, the direction of play changes.
8. If you play a "Skip" card, the next player's turn is skipped.
9. The game continues until one player has no cards left in their hand and is declared the winner.

## Customization

You can customize this code in various ways:

- Change the number of players by modifying the `num_players` variable.
- Add more complex Uno rules and special cards.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Create a scoring system or keep track of multiple rounds.

## Requirements

This Uno game code requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or dependencies are needed.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding features, improving the code, or fixing bugs. Create a pull request, and your changes will be considered for inclusion.

## License

This Uno game code is available under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for details.

Enjoy playing Uno!
